,,Discover Collectively Open Science Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/ to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
